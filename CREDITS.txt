Although I (Roderick W. Smith) am releasing rEFInd in its current form, the
program is not the work of a single person. Others have contributed to the
program, both in its original version (rEFIt) and by providing features
I've incorporated into the current version. Specifically:

* Christoph Pfisterer was the original author of rEFIt. See its Web page,
  http://refit.sourceforge.net, for this version of the program. Christoph
  has therefore contributed more to rEFInd than anybody else, myself
  included; my changes are comparatively small additions to the original
  rEFIt base.

* The Debian project has made a version of rEFIt available that
  incorporates a number of patches, all attributed to Julien BLACHE
  (jblache@debian.org), to enable it to build properly on a Linux system.
  It was this version of rEFIt that I used as a starting point for creating
  rEFInd. See http://packages.debian.org/sid/refit for this version of the
  program.

* I replaced many of the original rEFIt icons with icons taken from the
  Oxygen Icons project, either from the Oxygen Refit package on its page
  (http://deviantdark.deviantart.com/art/Oxygen-Refit-70199755) or from the
  oxygen-icons version 4.7.4 package on my Gentoo Linux development system.
  These icons are released under the LGPLv3 or GPLv3. If I'm reading the
  pages correctly, the original creator was David Vignoni (aka
  "deviantdark" on the deviantart site).

* The Linux Mint icon comes from the Linux Mint 11.1 user guide
  (http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/linuxmint.com/docs/user-guide/)
